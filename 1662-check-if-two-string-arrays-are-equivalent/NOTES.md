â€‹Algorithm:

START
Initialize Two string builders s1 and s2
Initialze i=0 and traverse the array using the maximum of the two words [word1 and word2]
If i is less than the word1 length, then append the word1 length to s1
Similarly do for the other word2
Now convert the array s1 into strings and check if they are equal.
END
